# Initial Setup

* Setup for deployment on Digital Ocean
    * Change base image?
    * Make a note of the steps I took to setup Droplet
        * Consider automating these via shell
    * Investigate scaling options on Digital Ocean.


# Video playback

* Speak to Matt about embedding Replay video. I've tried using the links delivered to iPhone / iPad links but the resulting video is very low resolution on a laptop / PC.
* What is the video quality like on an iPad -- is the code as readable as on desktop?
