## Development environment

* Add explanation of tests (how to run, feature syntax, capybara), server logging, and server restarting / monitoring to README
* Add explanation of how to report bugs / front-end or provisioning feature requests.
* Monitor task only needs to watch for changes to flippd.rb and routes/* ? Won't Sinatra automatically reload everything else?

##Â Production environment

* Fix Google sign in problem (https://console.developers.google.com)
