# Initial Setup

* Extend app/hello.rb
    * Switch to a template (erb?)
    * Embed a replay video

* Consider switching to Salt (or Ansible?) because Chef seems overcomplicated

* Setup for deployment on Digital Ocean
    * Change base image?
    * Add Vagrant omnibus so that chef version is specified (and to support Digital Ocean)?

* Make a note of the steps I took to setup Droplet
    * Consider automating these via shell or Salt (Ansible?)
