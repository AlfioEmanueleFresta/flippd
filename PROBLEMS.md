# Reporting problems

If you encounter a bug when using DAMS (either locally, or at `http://dams.flippd.it`), please [open an issue](https://github.com/flippd/flippd/issues) which describes how I can reproduce the problem from a fresh Flippd installation.

If you would like to request a feature (including changes to the HTML, CSS, Javascript or to the VM), please [open an issue](https://github.com/flippd/flippd/issues) describing what you'd like to see and why. It'd be great if you can give an example of other web applications that have this feature, if possible.
